      "The idea for the mouse — a pointing device that would roll on a desk — occurred to Dr. Engelbart in 1964 while he was attending a computer graphics conference. \n",
      "\n",
      "He and his team developed computer interface elements such as bitmapped screens, the mouse, hypertext, collaborative tools, and precursors to the graphical user interface. \n",

      "Two decades later, when Steve Jobs added the mouse to his Macintosh computer, he decided that a single button was appropriate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Engelbart later revealed that it was nicknamed the \"mouse\" because the tail came out the end. \n",
      "\n",
      "In later years, one of those inventions was given a warmhearted name, evoking a small, furry creature given to scurrying across flat surfaces: the computer mouse. \n",

      "\"[2] He was honored with the Norbert Wiener Award, which is given annually by Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility. \n",

      "Witness the 1968 debut of the mouse and keyset, and watch the mouse and keyset in action   in Doug's 1968 \"Mother of All Demos\" (see SRI's   1968 Demo Highlights for more) Watch \"The Computer Mouse\", a video short on how the  mouse changed lives and enabled the personal computing industry to take off and thrive. \n",
      "\n",
      "Note that the patent for the mouse was filed in 1967, by which time production models were in operational use throughout Doug's lab, three years before Xerox PARC was established in 1970. \n",

      "This was the first mouse (pictured above and below). \n",

      "NLS, the \"oN-Line System,\" developed by the Augmentation Research Center under Engelbart's guidance with funding primarily from ARPA (as DARPA was then known), demonstrated numerous technologies, most of which are now in widespread use; it included the computer mouse, bitmapped screens, hypertext; all of which were displayed at \"The Mother of All Demos\" in 1968. \n",
      "\n",
      "The mouse later migrated from Doug's lab at SRI   to Xerox PARC, and then to Apple and others. \n",

      "In 1988, Resolution WHA42.19 was passed, calling for the celebration of World No Tobacco Day, every year on 31 May. \n",

      "In the past twenty one years, the day has been met with both enthusiasm and resistance around the globe from governments, public health organizations, smokers, growers, and the tobacco industry. \n",

      "WNTD publicity materials provide an \"official\" interpretation of the most up-to-date tobacco-related research and statistics and provide a common ground from which to formulate anti-tobacco arguments around the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "[29] World No Tobacco Days have not induced a positive vocal response from the tobacco industry. \n",
      "\n",
      "[31] In Uganda, since the World No Tobacco Day is the one day that the media is obligated to publicize tobacco control issues, the British American Tobacco company uses the eve of the day to administer counter-publicity. \n",
      "\n",
      "In 1987, the World Health Assembly passed Resolution WHA40.38, calling for 7 April 1988 to be a \"a world no-smoking day.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "World No Tobacco Day Awards are given to individuals from six different world regions (Africa, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, South-East Asia, and Western Pacific), and Director-General Special Awards and Recognition Certificates are given to individuals from any region. \n",

      "WNTD is one of eight official global public health campaigns marked by the WHO, along with World Health Day, World Blood Donor Day, World Immunization Week, World Tuberculosis Day, World Malaria Day, World Hepatitis Day, and World AIDS Day. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, a memo made publicly available through the Tobacco Archives website was sent out to executives of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in preparation for the third annual World No Tobacco Day,[30] which had the theme of \"Childhood and Youth Without Tobacco\". \n",
      "\n",
      "[22][23] The day has also been used as a springboard for discussing the current and future state of a country as it relates to tobacco—for example in India which, with 275 million tobacco users, has one of the highest levels of tobacco consumption in the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"[26] Similarly, \"Americans for Freedom of Choice\", a group in Honolulu, Hawaii, organized \"World Defiance Day\" in response to WNTD and Hawaii's statewide ban on smoking in restaurants. \n",
      "\n",
      "The day is further intended to draw attention to the widespread prevalence of tobacco use and to negative health effects, which currently lead to more than 8 million deaths each year worldwide, including 1.2 million are the result of non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke. \n",
      "\n",
      "From ignoring WNTD, to participating in protests or acts of defiance, to bookending the day with extra rounds of pro-tobacco advertisements and events, smokers, tobacco growers, and the tobacco industry have found ways to make their opinions heard. \n",
      "\n",
      "[2] Each year, the WHO selects a theme for the day in order to create a more unified global message for WNTD. \n",
      "\n",
      "[32] Unlike the tobacco industry, some major pharmaceutical companies do publicly support WNTD. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"[33] Many tobacco growers feel that anti-tobacco efforts by organizations such as the WHO jeopardize their rights. \n",
      "\n",
      "The memo includes a warning about the upcoming day, a document that explains the arguments they anticipate the WHO making, and an explanation of how the company should respond to these claims. \n",
      "\n",
      "[19] Since 1988 the WHO has presented one or more awards to organizations or individuals who have made exceptional contributions to reducing tobacco consumption. \n",
      "\n",
      "[21] In addition, many governments use WNTD as the start date for implementing new smoking bans and tobacco control efforts. \n",
      "\n",
      "In 2001, their strategy included events such as a visit with the President of the International Tobacco Growers Association. \n",
      "\n",
      "The campaign also serves as a call to action, advocating for effective policies to reduce tobacco consumption and engaging stakeholders across multiple sectors in the fight for tobacco control. \n",
      "\n",
      "The campaign will increase awareness on: the negative impact that tobacco has on peopleâs lung health, from cancer to chronic respiratory disease, the fundamental role lungs play for the health and well-being of all people. \n",
      "\n",
      "[37] For decades, the tobacco industry has deliberately employed strategic, aggressive and well-resourced tactics to attract youth to tobacco and nicotine products. \n",
      "\n",
      "They also argue that these efforts may gang up on manufacturers of tobacco and be an attack on the industry, therefore hurting the growers. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the International Tobacco Growers Association (ITGA) argues that poor farmers in Africa may suffer the consequences if WHO anti-tobacco movements succeed. \n",
      "\n",
      "[27] Historically, in America the tobacco industry has funded state initiatives that provide resources to help smokers quit smoking as per the Master Settlement Agreement regulated by the U.S. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, on 31 May 2008, a section of the Smoke Free Ontario Act came into effect banning tobacco \"power walls\" and displays at stores in this Canadian province, and all hospitals and government offices in Australia became smoke-free on 31 May 2010. \n",
      "\n",
      "Internal industry documents reveal in-depth research and calculated approaches designed to attract a new generation of tobacco users, from product design to marketing campaigns aimed at replacing the millions of people who die each year from tobacco-attributable diseases with new consumers â youth. \n",
      "\n",
      "[36] It is possible that a 2015 survey from Health Canada concerning future tobacco control legislation in Canada, having a section requesting advice from indigenous peoples within Canada, showed the potential of concern over such issues. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the Oregon Commentator, an independent conservative journal of opinion published at the University of Oregon, hosted a \"Great American Smoke-in\" on campus as a counter to the locally more widespread Great American Smokeout: \"In response to the ever-increasing vilification of smokers on campus, the Oregon Commentator presents the Great American Smoke-in as an opportunity for students to join together and enjoy the pleasures of fine tobacco products. \n",
